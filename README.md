## Purpose

This work proposes a lightweight GRU-based deep learning (DL) model to classify between an attack state and a benign state. To reduce the latency in real-time prediction on the edge, the costly activation layer is substituted by LUT, which is configured by a neural network with optimal hyperparameters.
